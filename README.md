Jexer - Java Text User Interface library
========================================

This library implements a text-based windowing system loosely
reminiscent of Borland's [Turbo
Vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) system.  It looks
like this:

Jexer works on both Xterm-like terminals and Swing, and supports
images in both Xterm and Swing.  On Swing, images are true color:

![Swing Snake Image](/screenshots/snake_swing.png?raw=true "Swing Snake Image")

On Xterm, images are dithered to a common palette:

Obtaining Jexer
---------------

Jexer is available on Maven Central:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.gitlab.klamonte</groupId>
  <artifactId>jexer</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.1</version>
</dependency>
```

Binary releases are available on SourceForge:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jexer/files/jexer/

The Jexer source code is hosted at: https://gitlab.com/klamonte/jexer



Documentation
-------------

* [Java API Docs](https://jexer.sourceforge.io/apidocs/api/index.html)

* [Wiki](https://gitlab.com/klamonte/jexer/wikis/home)



Programming Examples
--------------------

The examples/ folder currently contains:

  * A [prototype tiling window
    manager](/examples/JexerTilingWindowManager.java) in less than 250
    lines of code.

  * A [prototype image thumbnail
    viewer](/examples/JexerImageViewer.java) in less than 350 lines of
    code.

jexer.demos contains official demos showing all of the existing UI
controls.  The demos can be run as follows:

  * 'java -jar jexer.jar' .  This will use System.in/out with
    Xterm-like sequences on non-Windows non-Mac platforms.  On Windows
    and Mac it will use a Swing JFrame.

  * 'java -Djexer.Swing=true -jar jexer.jar' .  This will always use
    Swing on any platform.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo2 PORT' (where PORT is a
    number to run the TCP daemon on).  This will use the Xterm backend
    on a telnet server that will update with screen size changes.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo3' .  This will use
    System.in/out with Xterm-like sequences.  One can see in the code
    how to pass a different InputReader and OutputReader to
    TApplication, permitting a different encoding than UTF-8.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo4' .  This demonstrates hidden
    windows and a custom TDesktop.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo5' .  This demonstrates two
    demo applications using different fonts in the same Swing frame.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo6' .  This demonstrates two
    applications performing I/O across three screens: an Xterm screen
    and Swing screen, monitored from a third Swing screen.

1 - Requires mouse support from host terminal.

2 - Also fails to filter out sixel data, leaving garbage on screen.

3 - Latest in repository.

4 - Requires TERM=xterm-1003 before starting.

5 - Opening image crashes terminal.
