Jexer - Java Text User Interface library
========================================

This library implements a text-based windowing system loosely
reminiscent of Borland's [Turbo
Vision](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_Vision) system.  It looks
like this:

![WezTerm, translucent images](/screenshots/wezterm_translucent_images.png?raw=true "WezTerm, translucent images")

...or this:

![Terminal, Image, Table](/screenshots/new_demo1.png?raw=true "Terminal, Image, Table")

...or anything in between.  Translucent windows -- including layered
images -- are supported and generally look as one would expect in a
modern graphical environment...but it's mostly text.  Translucent
windows were inspired in part by
[notcurses](https://github.com/dankamongmen/notcurses).

Jexer works on both Xterm-like terminals and Swing, and supports
images in both Xterm and Swing.  On Swing, images are true color; on
Xterm, images are rendered as sixel, iTerm2, or Jexer images.

Support for pixel-based operations was introduced in version 1.5.0.
If the terminal supports mouse mode 1016 (SGR-Pixel), one can now get
smooth(er) mouse motion with custom bitmap overlaid mouse.  Below is
stock xterm, with a custom mouse icon, and SGR-Pixel mode active:

![Xterm SGR-Pixel Mouse](/screenshots/xterm_pixel_mouse.gif?raw=true "Xterm SGR-Pixel Mouse")

A new sixel encoder was introduced in version 1.6.0, and looks and
performs much better.  This encoder was inspired in part by
[chafa's](https://hpjansson.org/chafa/) high-performance principal
component analysis based sixel encoder.

Jexer can be run inside its own terminal window, with support for all
of its features including images and mouse, and more terminals:

  features are so that you can implement them in a different
  system/language.



Programming Examples
--------------------

See [Xterm Window Manager](https://xtermwm.sourceforge.io) for a more
comprehensive demonstration of what Jexer can accomplish.  Here one
can see a floating terminal window over tiled terminals, two of which
are showing images:

![Floating terminal over tiled terminals](/screenshots/floating_terminal.png?raw=true "Floating terminal over tiled terminals")

Jexer's examples/ folder currently contains:

  * A [prototype tiling window
    manager](/examples/JexerTilingWindowManager.java) in less than 250
    lines of code.

  * A much slicker [prototype tiling window
    manager](/examples/JexerTilingWindowManager2.java) in less than 200
    lines of code.

  * A [prototype image thumbnail
    viewer](/examples/JexerImageViewer.java) in less than 350 lines of
    code.

  * A [prototype Xterm video player (using JavaCV to decode video
    frames)](/examples/XtermVideoPlayer.java) in less than 200 lines
    of code.

jexer.demos contains official demos showing all of the existing UI
controls.  The demos can be run as follows:

  * 'java -jar jexer.jar' .  This will use System.in/out with
    Xterm-like sequences on non-Windows non-Mac platforms.  On Windows
    and Mac it will use a Swing JFrame.

  * 'java -Djexer.Swing=true -jar jexer.jar' .  This will always use
    Swing on any platform.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo2 PORT' (where PORT is a
    number to run the TCP daemon on).  This will use the Xterm backend
    on a telnet server that will update with screen size changes.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo3' .  This will use
    System.in/out with Xterm-like sequences.  One can see in the code
    how to pass a different InputReader and OutputReader to
    TApplication, permitting a different encoding than UTF-8; in this
    case, code page 437.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo4' .  This demonstrates hidden
    windows and a custom TDesktop.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo5' .  This demonstrates two
    demo applications using different fonts in the same Swing frame.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo6' .  This demonstrates two
    applications performing I/O across three screens: an Xterm screen
    and Swing screen, monitored from a third Swing screen.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo7' .  This demonstrates the
    BoxLayoutManager, achieving a similar result as the
    javax.swing.BoxLayout apidocs example.

  * 'java -cp jexer.jar jexer.demos.Demo8 PORT' (where PORT is a
    number to run the TCP daemon on).  This will use the Xterm backend
    on a telnet server to share one screen to many terminals.



Terminal Support
----------------

Most popular terminals can run Jexer, but only a few support all of
Jexer's features.  Jexer is actively developed against
[xterm](https://invisible-island.net/xterm/) and
[wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/) .  The table below lists
the terminals last tested against Jexer:

2 - Also fails to filter out sixel data, leaving garbage on screen.

3 - Latest in repository.

3b - Latest in repository, using graphics PR branch.

4 - Requires TERM=xterm-1003 before starting.

5 - Sixel images can crash terminal.

    WSL-1 Debian instance.

7 - Both sixel and iTerm2 images.

8 - Using jerch's xterm-addon-image.
